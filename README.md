# CFX-Java

This project is an implementation of the C# SDK in Java.

CFX has the capability for messaging as well as for peer-to-peer communication. We tried a couple of available java AMPQ libraries, but none supported the peer-to-peer part properly or as expected. As we do not have enough time to add this feature to an existing lib we will no longer continue this project.

If you find a lib which supports this option and like to have a java sdk simply let us know; maybe we reanimate this project.
