/**
 * A connector can be pressed with force that iproportional to the 
            actual resisting force detected during the pressing cycle.We call 
            this Percent Above Range Sample, or PARS.In this technique, 
            the connectorâ€™s resisting force while pressing is
            sampled and averaged over a distance range above final seating to 
            the board surface. The final force percent added assures complete 
            seating of the connector.This is the most widely used technique
            because it limits the stress to the assembly, but does not require 
            great accuracy for board thickness measurement.
